## InfiniteLibrary at a Glance
InfiniteLibrary is a full-stack web app for listing and reviewing books, where users can add books to the collection and leave reviews for their friends to see.


##### InfiniteLibrary at a glance
![InfiniteLibrary at a glance](overview.png)

InfiniteLibrary allows users to add bibliographic listings for books, with cover art automatically supplied via the Google Books API, and to add reviews to books already listed.

##### Adding books
<!-- ![Feed search and collection creation](feedsearch.png) -->

Users can add new books via a form which allows them to enter a title, author, and optionally a date of publication for the new bibliographic record. The app then automatically retrieves a matching cover image (if one exists) and generates the record.

## Frontend Overview
InfiniteLibrary uses an Express.js server on the frontend, with the React framework providing the interface. The frontend also interfaces with an external API to provide cover images automatically, via Google Books.

### Frontend Technologies Used:
#### React
The frontend server is written in React.js with Redux, allowing for a clear and directed flow of information between nested components.

### Google Books API

## Backend Overview
The backend server, written in Flask, does no significant processing, and mainly performs read/write functions with respect to the PostgreSQL database which stores user information as well as details on individual feeds and collections.

### Backend Technologies Used
#### PostgreSQL
